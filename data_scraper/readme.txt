1. Download this directory to your computer.
2. Ensure Node.js is installed and executable through your command line interface of choice.
3. Run 'scrape_data.js' using Node.

NOTE: All dependencies are located within this directory, so there is no need to install any packages. :)
	- In fact, some of the dependencies have been modified, so reinstalling them may break the program.

The scraped data will be available in folder '\data_xxxxxxxxxxxxx' where x is the data's timestamp (UNIX milliseconds since 1/1/1970).
